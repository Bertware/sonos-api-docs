## Your checklist for this pull request

ðŸš¨ Please review the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/svrooij/sonos-api-docs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this repository.

- [ ] Make sure you are requesting to **pull a topic/feature/bugfix branch** (right side). Don't request your main!
- [ ] Make sure you are making a pull request against the **main branch** (left side). Also you should start *your branch* off *svrooij/sonos-api-docs/main*.
- [ ] Check your code additions will fail neither code linting checks nor unit test. (mine sometimes also fail, will probably ignore the lint failures)
- [ ] If you changed the **documentation.json** be sure to also [regenerate](https://sonos.svrooij.io/developers.html#regenerate-documentation) the services files.
- [ ] The `docs/services/index.md` and the `docs/services/*.md` files should not be manually changed, only with the generator.

ðŸ’” Thank you!
